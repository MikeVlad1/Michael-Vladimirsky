I modeled this lightsaber hilt in Fusion 360 after finding a design online that just looked really cool. It gave me a fun way to practice more advanced modeling features like revolved bodies, fillets, and adding clean mechanical details.

    I broke the model into parts like the emitter, grip, and pommel to keep it organized and closer to how a real lightsaber might be built.

Eventually, I want to turn it into a functional prop, something that lights up and has a retractable blade. I’m currently figuring out how to fit a simple LED system and blade mechanism inside the hilt without changing the overall look. For now, it’s just a 3D model, but it’s the first step toward building a working version.
