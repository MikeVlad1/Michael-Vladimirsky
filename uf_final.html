For this project, I designed and built a multi-stage audio amplifier to play a quiet and noisy Christmas song. The circuit was divided into four main stages, each with a specific function to clean and amplify the audio signal.

  <p>
    The first stage was an active high-pass filter that removed the DC offset while providing significant amplification, with a gain of around 450.

Next, I implemented a variable-gain amplifier using a potentiometer, which allowed me to fine-tune the output; in my setup, this stage provided up to 1.8x gain. Both of these stages used inverting op-amp configurations, resulting in an overall non-inverting signal path due to the double inversion.

To ensure clean delivery to the output, I added a buffered output stage using a unity-gain op-amp, which helped prevent loading effects. Finally, I incorporated a clip detection circuit to monitor whether the signal was nearing saturation and distorting, allowing for better control of audio quality shown down below.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of op-amp design, signal conditioning, and audio circuitry.
